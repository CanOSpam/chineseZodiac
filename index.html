            <h3>Story of the Chinese Zodiac</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              The well-trodden (no pun intended) story of the Chinese zodiac
              is cute, but a bit trite. The tale usually begins with the Jade
              Emperor, or Buddha, depending on the teller, who summoned all the
              animals of the universe for a race, or a banquet, depending on
              the teller. The 12 animals of the zodiac all headed to the palace.
              The order that they came in determined the order of the zodiac. The
              order is as follows: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse,
              Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.
            </p>

            <p>
              During the journey, however, the
              animals got involved in everything from high jinx to heroism. For example
              the rat, who won the race, only did so through guile and trickery:
              it jumped onto the back of the ox and won by a nose. The snake, apparently
              also a little sneaky, hid on the hoof of a horse in order to cross a
              river. When they got to the other side, it scared the horse and beat
              it in the contest. The dragon however, proved to be honorable and altruistic.
              By all accounts the dragon would have won the race as it could fly, but it
              had stopped to help villagers caught in a flooding river cross safely, or
              it stopped to assist the rabbit in crossing the river, or it stopped to help
              create rain for a drought-ridden farmland, depending on the teller.

            <h3>Actual history of the Chinese Zodiac</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              The actual history behind the Chinese zodiac is a much less
              fantastical and much harder to find. It’s known from pottery
              artifacts that the animals of the zodiac were popular in the Tang
              Dynasty (618-907 A.D.), but they were also seen much earlier from
              artifacts from the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.), a period of
              disunity in ancient Chinese history, as differing factions fought
              for control.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s been written that the animals of the zodiac
              were brought to China via the Silk Road, the same central Asian
              trade route that brought the Buddhist belief from India to China.
              But some scholars argue that the belief predates Buddhism and has
              origins in early Chinese astronomy that used the planet Jupiter as a
              constant, as its orbit around the earth took place every 12 years.
              Still others have argued that the use of animals in astrology began
              with nomadic tribes in ancient China who developed a calendar based on
              the animals they used to hunt and gather.

            <p>
              People born in the Year of Rooster according to Chinese zodiac
              have many excellent characteristics, such as being honest, bright,
              communicative and ambitious. Most of them are born pretty or
              handsome, and prefer to dress up. In daily life, they seldom rely
              on others. However, they might be enthusiastic about something
              quickly, but soon be impassive. Thus, they need to have enough
              faiths and patience to insist on one thing.

            <h3>Fortune for 2016 and 2017</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              Detailed predictions show that they will have a relatively good
              year in 2016. They would go though some sudden changes in work,
              like job promotion or transfer. The relationships with their
              beloved are kind of stable, and they do not need to worry too
              much about the fitness. Things take a bad turn in the coming 2017,
              which is the Zodiac Year of Birth for people with Chinese zodiac
              sign 'Rooster'. They are likely to fall on evil days in career
              and economy, and the best remedy is to fully devote themselves in
              work and fasten the belt to reduce the cost.

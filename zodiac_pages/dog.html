                People born in the Year of Dog have wonderful fortune in
                the year 2016. Things will go as smooth as they expect
                most of the time. Nevertheless, they should avoid conflicts
                with their parents. In the following 2017, the lucky star is
                still around them. There will be some big breakthroughs in
                their career. Possibly, they will get a salary raise or
                promotion in the Year of Rooster. They should be modest, and
                take othersâ€™ advice. A balance between work and rest will help
                to solve the problems in their health.

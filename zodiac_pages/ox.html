            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              Ranking second in Chinese zodiacal signs, the Ox is huge. People
              often use it to indicate something big in size or number. People
              born in the Year of Ox bear persistent, simple, honest, and
              straightforward characteristics. They are talent leaders with
              strong faith, and strong devotion to work. They are contemplative
              before taking actions, not easily affected by the surroundings but
              just follow their concept and ability. Being conservative with a
              lack of wit in speaking, they usually look silent and sometimes
              stubborn in their old ways.

            <h3>Fortune for 2016 and 2017</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              In 2016, everything will take a turn for the better. As the luck
              returns, people with Chinese zodiac sign Ox also become more
              confident in work, willing to take challenges. They are able to
              live a well-off life and stay at ease. The relationship with peers
              becomes harmonious, and there might be some disputes with their
              lovers. 2017 is going to be luckier. They are very likely to make
              large improvement in career, wealth, and love. But the relationship
              with colleagues may come across some issues. For both years,
              digestive problems might be the major health concern.

              The general image of people with Chinese zodiac sign 'Monkey'
              is of always being smart, clever and intelligent, especially
              in their career and wealth. They are lively, flexible,
              quick-witted and versatile. In addition, their gentleness and
              honesty bring them an everlasting love life. Although they were
              born with enviable skills, they still have several shortcomings,
              such as an impetuous temper and a tendency to look down upon others.

            <h3>Fortune for 2016 and 2017</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              2016 is the Zodiac Year of Birth (Ben Ming Nian) for people
              born in the Year of Monkey, so their overall fortune might not
              be smooth in the whole year. There will be many challenges in
              their career, and they also need to keep a serious attitude towards
              conflicts in love life. However, when ringing in 2017, they get
              favorable luck in work and finance, and they could also get relief
              from stress in interpersonal relationship. As long as they stay
              persistent, they can surely make progress as they expect.

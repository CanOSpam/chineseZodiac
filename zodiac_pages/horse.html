            <p>
              People born in a year of the Horse are extremely animated, active
              and energetic. Horses love to be in a crowd, and they can usually
              be seen on such occasions as concerts, theater performances,
              meetings, sporting events, and parties. With a deft sense of humor,
              Horses are masters of repartee. They love to take center stage and
              delight audiences everywhere. Sometimes, the Horse is a little
              self-centered, but it doesn't mean that s/he can not be interested
              in others' problems. Horses are really more cunning than
              intelligent, and that is probably why most Horse people lack real
              confidence.

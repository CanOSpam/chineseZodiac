            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              People with Chinese zodiac sign Pig are considerate, responsible,
              independent and optimistic. They always show generousness and
              mercy to endure other people's mistakes, which help them gain
              harmonious interpersonal relationship. However, sometimes they
              would behave lazy and lack actions. In addition, pure hearts would
              let them be cheated easily in daily life.

            <h3>Fortune for 2016 and 2017</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              In general, 2016 is quite a nice year for people of the Chinese
              zodiac sign Rabbit. Everything goes smoothly as they planned
              before. If they could seize favorable opportunities, they can
              make some outstanding progresses. However, their luck prediction
              in 2017 is not that desirable. They may face some difficulties in
              work, which may further influence their income. The relationship
              with lovers is not stable. They have to deal with all matters
              patiently.

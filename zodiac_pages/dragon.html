            <p>
              People with Chinese zodiac sign 'Dragon' are usually a group of people who are
              lively, intellectual and excitable. They can clearly tell right from wrong.
              They are upright and frank. However, they are also a bit arrogant and impatient.
              Female Dragons tend to be overly confident. They hate hypocrisy, gossip and
              slander. They are not afraid of difficulties but hate to be used or controlled by others.

            <p>
              During 2016, everything takes a turn for the better for people born in the Year of
              Dragon. In career and wealth, they are given more opportunities to utilize their
              talents and expand business. Fortune in interpersonal relationships is also favorable,
              and there is no big problem in their fitness. The overall luck in 2017 is similar
              with the previous year. They will not be difficult to find nice development opportunities
